# RRCA12p model notes

## Model website
[Republican River Compact Administration](http://www.republicanrivercompact.org/)

## Model purpose
 - Court case Kansas v Nebraska and Colorado stipulated that a groundwater flow model should be constructed
 - Model is focused on getting streamflow right, not necessarily head. Stated purpose is to: 
  - Quantify amount, location, and timing of streamflow depletion caused by pumping
  - Quantify streamflow accretion caused by importing water from Platte River Basin into Republican River Basin
 - Domain extends beyond just RR basin - goes from Platte River in N to Ogallala aquifer outcrops on S, E, W boundaries (~30,000 square miles total)

## Basics
 - LENUNI = 1 (length unit is feet)
 - ITMUNI = 1 (time unit is seconds)
 - SS first timestep, transient 1918-2000, monthly stress periods, 2 timesteps/stress period
 - Grid cell size = 1 square mile = 5280 ft x 5280 ft
 - Single layer model, constant transmissivity through time
